# The-Dice-Game

This is a project that comes as a challenge from the Udemy course **The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp** taught by Dr Angela Yu.

The Project uses HTML, CSS and JS.

Simple shades of Blue with sans-serif were used to make the project look like a fun and addictive game.

The project does not make the use of dice images as instructed in the course. Instead HTML elements are used to create the dice.

As additional elements, the Game keeps a track of the games played in a particular session. Reset button is provided that resets the session and displays the wins for each player in an alert box.
